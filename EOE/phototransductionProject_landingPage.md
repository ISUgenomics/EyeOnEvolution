## Description of project

We propose to use eyes and light-sensitive tissues as a model to understand the relationship of genetic complexity and the evolution of novel traits through the non-mutually exclusive processes of exaptation and adaptation, by studying two co-option mechanisms:

1. gene sharing, where a single gene is deployed in two different biological systems [14,15], and

2. gene duplication and functional specialization of the resulting gene copies through adaptation [16,17].
