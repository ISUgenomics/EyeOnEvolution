# Questions

This section are both for questions we aim to answer in our grant and other questions that we may be able to answer given the data available and the data we will collect.

## Directly from the proposal

1. Are lineages with pallial eyes associated with gene family expansions of the phototransduction pathway members?
2. What is the degree of similarity of the phototransduction machinery among the different photoreceptive structures within a species and between lineages?
3. Do all pallial eyes acquire their phototransduction pathways following the same evolutionary trajectories or do pallial eyes in different lineages have unique evolutionary paths to photosensitivity?

## Other questions


A) [  What data is currently available in NCBI related to Mollusks?](EOE/Questions/Q_A.md)
