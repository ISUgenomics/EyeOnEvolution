### Description of project

We propose to use eyes and light-sensitive tissues as a model to understand the relationship of genetic complexity and the evolution of novel traits through the non-mutually exclusive processes of exaptation and adaptation, by studying two co-option mechanisms:

1. gene sharing, where a single gene is deployed in two different biological systems [14,15], and

2. gene duplication and functional specialization of the resulting gene copies through adaptation [16,17].

Eyes of pteriomorphian bivalves are an excellent system to study these evolutionary processes. This is because: (a) eyes have evolved in at least three separate pteriomorph lineages [18]; (b) the taxonomic group exhibits an impressive degree of morphological disparity of eye types [19]; and (c) closely-related eyed and eyeless species-pairs exist. Because it is less likely that the molecular machinery involved in photoreception was re-created in each bivalve lineage during the repeated evolution of eyes, the origin of each eye type would require the repurposing or diversification of the molecular machinery from an ancestral photoreceptive structure, such as the light-sensing neurons in the mantle lobes [20] or larval eyespot [19]. Thus, shared gene homologs between either of these structures and eyes are the probable evolutionary source of the photoreception machinery in eyes. Tissue-specific RNA-seq and comparative genomic tools are now available to directly assess the roles of genes/genetic architecture in photoreception during the evolutionary emergence of the eyes in different lineages. By comparing the pattern of genes expressed among these three types of photoreceptive structures (eyes, mantle, and larval eyespot), one non-photoreceptive tissue (adductor muscle), and associated genomes among eyed and eyeless species, we will address the following:

1. Are lineages with pallial eyes associated with gene family expansions of the phototransduction pathway members?
2.  What is the degree of similarity of the phototransduction machinery among the different photoreceptive structures within a species and between lineages?
3. Do all pallial eyes acquire their phototransduction pathways following the same evolutionary trajectories or do pallial eyes in different lineages have unique evolutionary paths to photosensitivity?
