# Definitions of key words

**Exaptation:** a trait whose current function differs from its original function
  * feathers [Prum & Brush 2002](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/341993)
  * lens crystallins [de Jong et al 1989](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.iastate.edu/science/article/pii/0968000489900091) [Tomarev & Piatigorsky 1996](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00449.x)
  * caffeine biosynthesis [Huang 2016](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/38/10613.short)
    * "In this study, we reveal that even though the caffeine molecule is identical in the cacao, citrus, guaran√°, coffee, and tea lineages, it is produced by different, previously unknown, biosynthetic pathways"

**Adaptation:** a trait that through natural selection still has its original function

**11-cis-retinal:**  a light sensitive chromophore that absorbs light and initiates phototransduction

**Opsin:** protein covalently bound to 11-cis retinal using a lysine residue in H7. They belong to a class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that have seven alpha-helical domains that transverse the cell membrane (H1-7) interspaed by loops that extend into the cytoplasm and outside of the photoreceptive cell. [Review by Palczewski 2006]()

**Photoreceptor types:** rabdomeric and ciliary cell [Porter 2012]() [Feuda 2014]() [Ramirez 2016](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/8/12/3640/2680042)
**Co-option:** [True and Carroll Review 2002](https://www-annualreviews-org.proxy.lib.iastate.edu/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.cellbio.18.020402.140619)

**gene sharing:** a single gene is deployed into two different biological systems

**duplication and functional specialization:** gene paralogs that have different functions or are active in different biological systems

**biological system:** a tissue, organ or pathway
