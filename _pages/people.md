Jeanne Serb is an evolutionary biologist whose work focuses on photosensory systems. She uses molluscs to study the genetic processes that drive the evolutionary conversion of non-visual tissue to a perceptual organ that senses light and to understand the biochemical mechanisms that are involved in light-sensitivity of proteins.  She currently is an Associate Professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Organismal Biology and the Director for the Office of Biotechnology at Iowa State University. As Director, Jeanne and her team work with Iowa Stateâ€™s biotechnology faculty and administrators to ensure effective research, training to K-12 educators, and technology transfer of molecular biology-related products.
