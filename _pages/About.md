# About

This website is the exploration and musing on a new project recently funded by NSF entitled "The roles of exaptive and adaptive co-option in eye evolution."  Here, both science and bioinformatics will intermingle with the goal of seeing the process of an NSF funded proposal from beginning to the end in real time so you can share in the trials and tribulations that occur in science and to give young scientists and the public a better sense of how science is  done.  If you are looking for a particular bioinformatics pipeline check out our [Bioinformatics Workbook](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/) where you can find everything from piplines for [RNA-Seq analysis](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/dataAnalysis/RNA-Seq/RNA-SeqIntro/RNAseq-using-a-genome.html) to easier problems such as [converting fastq to fasta](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/dataWrangling/fastaq-manipulations/converting-fastq-format-to-fasta.html) and much more.
